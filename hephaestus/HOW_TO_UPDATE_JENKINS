How to update Jenkins?
---

1) bump the version of the Jenkins image to the most recent available -lts version

2) build the new image (as root)

# podman build . -t hephaestus.next

3) Delete the content (if any) of the 'next/' folder.

4) start the associated service

# systemctl start hephaestus.next

Check that the service has successfully started and then log into /jenkins.next and double check the new service does use the new image.

If everything looks good, shutdown jenkins.next, clean the next/ folder, commit the version upgrade in ares and then update the hephaestus image.

Before restarting the associated service with the new images, rename the plugins/ folder to plugins.old (inside Jenkins' home) to ensure the plugins are reinstalled properly.
